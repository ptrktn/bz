	* Changes based on ezscroll version 1.4. All modifications are
	wrapped with -D_GLONLY macros which effectively make this program
	compile without X. Features that are not implemented using GL
	event model are mouse events and Mover(). Rotation control is
	implemented using '"vi arrow keys" and myChangeView().

	* Added ChangeLog and COPYING files.
