# Define model here.
# 1:   Spatially homegeneous 3D system.
MODEL 1
# 2:   Dimensionless simulation.
# MODEL 2
# 3:   Closed system, diffusion source of a at z = 0, value of phi is used
# MODEL 3
# 4:   Closed 1D system, diffusion source of a at z = 0.
#      In this case, NZ defines the system length
# MODEL 4
# 5:   FKN 1D system, diffusion source of a at z = 0.
#      In this case, NZ defines the system length
